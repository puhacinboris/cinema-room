# Cinema Room

### This project was a good opportunity to work with input and output in Kotlin. It also helped with learnig lists, functions, loops, conditional statements, exeptions and as well as writing a clean code.
##
### Project prompts user to create cinema room by entering number of rows and seats.
### After that a menu will be shown to the user. There is three options. 
### By entering 1 user can see how the seating arrangements in cinema look like.
### By entering 2 user can buy a ticket. Depending on the size of cinema ticket can cost $10 or $8.
### If the cinema room has 60 or less seats ticket costs $10 and if the cinema room has more than 60 seats ticket for the first half of the room costs $10 and for the second half $8.
### After purchasing a ticket user will be again promoted with a menu. 
### By entering 1 user can see where his bought seat is. 
### By entering 2 user can buy another seat and by entering 3 user can see statics.
### By entering 0 application shuts down.
